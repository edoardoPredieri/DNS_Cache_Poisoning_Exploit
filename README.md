This attack consists of inserting a DNS record into the cache of the
DNS nameserver dnsserver which binds an arbitrary IP to the name banko-
fallan.co.uk.
In this way all future requests destined to bankofallan.co.ukâ€™s dnsserver will
obtain as reply the arbitrary IP embedded in the caches.
To simulate this attack we have used a virtual machine (vulnDNS) that con-
tains the dnsserver and its environment and a normal computer that simu-
lated the attacker, which controls the domain badguy.ru and the nameserver
for this domain.



In order to execute the exploit, please follow these steps:

In vulnDNS type:
	$ route add default gw 192.168.56.1
	$ service vulnDNS restart


In Attacker's PC type:
	$ sudo pip2 install dnslib
	$ sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.1 dev lo

	Inside exploit.py change the global variable "ip_attacker" with the attacker's machine IP.
